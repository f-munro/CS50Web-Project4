# CS50 Web Development

## Project 4 - Network

This was my submission for project 4 in the CS50 Web Development Course. This project inlvolved using Django to develop a social media site with a news feed and profile pages for users. 
Users can follow each other and make posts. JavaScript is used to implement the dynamic liking
and editing of posts.

This project involves a lot of DOM manipulation due to all the posts. I realised part way through that it probably would have been a better idea to get more comfortable with React and use that, so that's something I'll consider in the next project.
